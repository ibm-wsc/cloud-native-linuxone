# Lab Logistics

The lab will be performed against a Red Hat OpenShift 4.12 cluster running in the IBM Washington Systems Center internal network.

Because it is in an internal network, it is accessible only through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection.
The instructors have already logged each student enivornment into the VPN.

During class you will be given a URL by the instructors which you will use to get a student environment to work with.  You will be asked to enter a password, which will be provided to you by the instructors.

Then, within the student environment, you will use another password to log in to the desktop.  Your instructors will give you this password as well.

During the lab, you will use three other sets of credentials which will be given to you by the instructors.

1. A userid and password for logging in to the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster
2. A userid and password for logging in to Gogs (Go-based Git Server)
3. A userid and password for logging in to the SonarQube server.
