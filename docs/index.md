# Cloud Native LinuxONE Workshop 

Welcome to our Cloud Native LinuxONE workshop. Developers can leverage OpenShift to create continuous integration pipelines for Linux® workloads on IBM Z® and LinuxONE. You can quickly get up and running on OpenShift with a continuous workflow.

## Agenda

* [Extend Pipeline to Upgrade from Development to Staging](application-promotion/promote_overview.md)
