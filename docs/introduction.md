# Cloud Native Workshop Introduction
You will build and deploy an application (the cloud-native way) using OpenShift Container Platform and its CI/CD workflow OpenShift Pipelines.

## Overall Architecture Image

One day an architecture image will sit here. Until then, enjoy this text.

## Lab Overview

You will set up a virtual pet clinic (based on the classic spring boot demo referenced in the main [documentation](https://projects.spring.io/spring-petclinic/){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} running on LinuxONE using source code on GitHub and OpenShift Pipelines to seamlessly update, test, and deploy your pet clinic.

This lab is broken into two parts:

1. Automating build and deploy of PetClinic Java application with OpenShift Pipelines

2. Promoting PetClinic from development to staging with testing and GitHub integration (adding the C [continuous] in CI/CD)
