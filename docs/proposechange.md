# How to propose a change

On the page you want to make a change to, click on the pencil icon next to the page's title. This will take you to edit the page in Github.

You will see a message similar to the following: "You’re editing a file in a project you don’t have write access to. Submitting a change to this file will write it to a new branch in your fork, so you can send a pull request."

Make your changes in Markdown. And submit for review.

The owners of this repo will review your pull request and accept or deny your change proposal.

There are other ways of doing a pull request, a Google search will lead you to those tutorials.
